### Custom Discord Theme Inspired by Robb Owenn and CelestialReaver

I've created a custom Discord theme inspired by [Robb Owenn's Synthwave VSCode theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode) and [CelestialReaver's Synthwave '84 theme](https://betterdiscord.app/theme/Synthwave%20%2784).

> _Please note that CelestialReaver's theme is currently outdated and may not work as expected._
